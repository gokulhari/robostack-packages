# robostack-packages

I use [robostack-neotic](https://github.com/RoboStack/ros-noetic) for ROS. 
The great thing about it is that you do not have to root install anything.
But then, I found that many packages are not easily installable using mamba
due to package dependency conflicts.

So here I am putting together packages that you can simply download into
your catkin workspace (e.g., ~/catkin_ws/src/), and call catkin_make, hopefully 
with no issues.
